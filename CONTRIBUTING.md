## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### **Setting Up Development Environment**

1. **Fork & Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cybersim-soc-simulator.git
   cd cybersim-soc-simulator
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Development Setup**
   - No build process required - pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   - Open `index.html` directly in browser for testing
   - Use browser dev tools for debugging
   - Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### **Code Standards & Best Practices**

#### **JavaScript Conventions**
```javascript
// Use descriptive variable names for SOC concepts
const incidentPriorityLevels = ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical']; // ✅ Good
const ipl = ['l', 'm', 'h', 'c'];                                    // ❌ Avoid

// Use camelCase for functions and variables
function createSecurityIncident() { }  // ✅ Good
function create_security_incident() { } // ❌ Avoid

// Comment complex SOC logic and cybersecurity concepts
// Calculate incident priority based on CVSS score and asset criticality
const priority = calculateIncidentPriority(cvssScore, assetCriticality);
```

#### **CSS/Styling Standards**
```css
/* Maintain SOC dashboard aesthetic with professional dark theme */
:root {
    --soc-primary: #3b82f6;
    --soc-danger: #ef4444;
    --soc-bg-primary: #0a0f1c;
}

/* Use semantic class names for SOC components */
.incident-card { }           /* ✅ Good - describes SOC concept */
.red-box { }                 /* ❌ Avoid - describes appearance only */

/* Group related SOC functionality */
.threat-detection {
    /* Threat detection specific styles */
}

.incident-response {
    /* Incident response specific styles */  
}
```

#### **Cybersecurity Content Standards**
- **Accuracy First** - All scenarios must be based on real threats and procedures
- **Industry Alignment** - Follow established frameworks (NIST, SANS, MITRE ATT&CK)
- **Educational Clarity** - Complex concepts explained clearly without losing accuracy
- **Current Relevance** - Focus on modern threats and contemporary SOC practices

## 🎓 SOC & Cybersecurity Content Guidelines

### **Incident Scenarios**
When contributing new security incidents:

**Required Elements:**
- **Realistic Attack Vector** - Based on actual TTPs from threat reports
- **Proper Classification** - Correct priority, category, and severity
- **Accurate Timeline** - Realistic progression and response times
- **Educational Value** - Teaches specific SOC skills or procedures
- **Industry Terminology** - Use standard cybersecurity vocabulary

**Scenario Template:**
```javascript
{
    id: 'INC-YYYY-XXX',
    priority: 'critical|high|medium|low',
    title: 'Descriptive Incident Title',
    description: 'Detailed but concise incident description',
    attack_vector: 'Initial Access → Execution → Persistence → Exfiltration',
    affected_systems: ['system-1', 'system-2'],
    iocs: ['192.168.1.1', 'malicious.exe', 'evil.com'],
    mitre_tactics: ['TA0001', 'TA0002'], // MITRE ATT&CK Tactics
    recommended_actions: ['contain', 'investigate', 'eradicate'],
    educational_notes: 'Key learning points for SOC analysts'
}
```
